Hi there ðŸ‘‹ These are the first and updated versions of my Hospital Patient Records - Power BI dashboard, built as an extension of my final year engineering project - a Scheduled Vending Machine with Vital Signs analysis.

Hospital Patient Records Dashboard:

- This Power BI dashboard provides a real-time overview of patient records in a hospital setting. It enables healthcare professionals to monitor key vital signs, medication adherence, and patient details efficiently.
- Users can filter data by hospital ward and Patient ID to focus on specific cases. The dashboard includes gauge charts to monitor body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels, making it easy to assess a patientâ€™s condition at a glance. Medicine adherence is shown in a donut chart, breaking down the percentage of doses taken v/s missed.
- A standout feature is the dynamic color formatting in the vital sign analysis slicers, which changes based on how extreme a patientâ€™s vitals are, offering a visual alert system for abnormal readings.
- The dashboard also displays essential patient details like age, gender, medical condition, admission date, and tentative discharge date, making it a useful tool for quick decision-making in hospital settings.

This dashboard is designed to enhance patient monitoring, facilitate data-driven decision-making, and improve hospital efficiency.
